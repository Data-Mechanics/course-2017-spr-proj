# Project Purporse/Narrative:

Cities are a very efficient way of storing humans. But what impact do trees and open spaces have on a city? Our project aims to help us gain a better understanding of the trees and public spaces in Boston, and what type of relationships they have on their respective cities (i.e energy consumption, happiness etc.)

We have collected data about how many open spaces and trees there are in Cambridge and Boston and processed/aggregated them for later use. In addition, we have also collected data about the energy usage of each location.

We calculated the ratio of open space area to total area of the location, the CO2 usage per person, and the MMBTU usage per person. We then draw a connection between how much open space there is and how much extra energy is used in each location. This begins to give us insight on the relationship between open spaces and general energy usage.

We also ran k-means on our tree's geographical data on each respective city. The goal was to better understand the trees in these cities, as well as to use the output locations to propose places where parks could be built etc.

### Running our code

Run execute.py. There is nothing unique about the scripts in this project that require special steps.
