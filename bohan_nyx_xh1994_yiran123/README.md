Author: Bohan Li, Ningyi Xue, Han Xiao, Yiran Pan

## Introduction
As one of the most famous online marketplaces and hospitality service websites, Airbnb becomes more and more popular among travelers all around the world. However, do travelers really know the Airbnb housing they choose to stay? Unlike looking for a traditional hotel on travel agency websites, customers usually need to spend more time on finding a safe and convenient house that matches their expectation because Airbnb let hosts provide all the information, which could lead to the lack of credibility. In our project, we decide to let the data talks. Besides the original Airbnb reviews given by customers, we also evaluate other factors that could affect the qualities of Airbnb housings in Boston Area. The goal of our project is to help potential Airbnb customers to choose the best Airbnb of they needs.
