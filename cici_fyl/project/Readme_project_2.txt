We try to figure out if the value of Boston properties depends mainly on their location. We used property tax as a way to determine value. 
We used the K-means algorithms, with our modification, to find the means of clusters of restaurants, schools and properties. From these clusters, we can determine where centroids are located in the populated ares. 
We then used correlation analysis to see if the distance between each property to the nearest mean is negatively correlated with propert's value. We believed that a shorter distance would yield a larger value. 
We found that the correlation is actually a small positive value with a small P-value, which means the correlation is statistically significant.
Tax probably was not a good indication of value. Also, Boston's property's value could depend on othe factors besides distance to dining and education. Factors such as rent, environment and etc could have effects on value.
