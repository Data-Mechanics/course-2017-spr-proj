README for Project 1
--------------------
The datasets that we have chosen for this project are from the City of Boston Data Portal, Cambridge Open Data Portal, and the MASS Data Portal. We are working to analyse the data in order to help determine a more efficient way to deal with crime. Currently, we are thinking of finding better patrol assignments for police forces in order to reduce crime rates. For example, we want to analyze the data in order to see which regions could use more police presence and which could use less in order to send police to monitor the right areas instead of wasting resources on regions that do not require much police activity. In order to do this, we plan on narrowing down high crime rate regions and find the correlation between police presence and crime density. We will also try to take in extraneous factors such as holidays and weather as well that may affect crime rates.

To start off, and for the purpose of project 1, we have manipulated the data to count the number of crimes reported in each police district/neighborhood in order to see which areas have more crimes committed. We then used our new data set and retrieved the actual street address and police station's district name along with the count of crimes each has. We also got the name of the streets that are in each police station's district by linking through zip codes.
