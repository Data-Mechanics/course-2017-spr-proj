# Project narrative

Our project seeks to explore the relationship between food accessibility, obesity and income in Boston's neighborhoods. We believe that we will find that a smaller income and a lack of close food sources in a neighborhood will correlate to a higher obesity percentage. In order to do this, we created a method to score each neighborhood based on how their accessible food sources are, and then we used this information to determine a correlation.

# Transformations

First, we combined the Farmers' Markets, Corner Markets, and Supermarkets datasets in order to create an overall Food Source dataset. In order to do this we needed to standardize the attribute names, as well as get rid of attributes that we deemed as unnecessary. Since not all of the datasets included latitude and longitude information, we used Google Maps Geocoding API in order to retrieve that information based on the address of the food source. (foodsources.py)

Second, we had to map the regions in the Obesity Statistics in Massachusetts to neighborhoods in Boston in order to calculate the percentage of people who had a BMI >= 30 per neighborhood. (obesityperneighborhood.py)

Third, we created a new dataset that combines information from all of the datasets to look at the relationships between information that will help us answer our overall project narrative. This new dataset includes the average income, total number of food sources and average obesity based on the neighborhood. (neighborhoodstatistics.py)

# Algorithms

### Calculating a Food Accessibility Score For Each Neighborhood: ###
In order to calculate a food accessibility score for each neighborhood we looked at three important factors: 
* The average number of food sources in the neighboorhood within walking distance of a residence. 
* The average distance to the closest food source for each residence.
* The average quality of the food source (based on how much of each type of food source there is) within walking distance

These three items have a huge impact on what it means to have a "good" food accessibility food score. Our main focus for the first metric was to get the average number of food sources that are within walking distance in the specified neighborhood. This is found by calculating the total number of food sources that are within walking distance per house and computing the mean. 

Next, we looked at what the average distance was to the closest food source per neighborhood. This was found by taking a list of closest food source distance per house for the specified neighborhood and calculating the mean. 

The last metric we look at, this one taking a bit more computation, was the average quality of food sources in the neighborhood. There were a few options that we considered when deciding how this number was going to be calculated. The one that seemed to make the most sense was to rank each type of food source and give it a 'weight'. So, a farmer's market had a weight of 1, a supermarket had a weight of 2/3, and a cornerstore had a weight of 1/3. We ranked them based on the healthiness of the food source, as well as the variety of foods that one could buy.

After finding these values for each house in the neighborhood, we calculated the mean of each metric (per house). After getting a matrix of the mean values, we converted each metric into z-scores, which standardizes the scores and allows each of the metrics to be compared. Then, we added them in order to create 1 final composite score for each neighborhood.

### Determining Correlation: ###

[[ 1.         -0.0243795  -0.41433783]
 [-0.0243795   1.         -0.54327576]
 [-0.41433783 -0.54327576  1.        ]]

Shown above is our coefficient correlation array
for our three variables containing data from foodscore, 
income, and obesity. Our calculations have determined that
each of our coefficient correlations have successfully fallen
in between the values 1 and -1. It appears that between each
pair of distinct variables, there is a slight negative assocation
that each variable has with each other. The 1's that are shown
are obviously the full association that each variable has with its 
own self. The variables' own coefficient correlation with itself
irrefutably lies on the positive line of best fit representing a 
positive correlation. 

Within our linear regression model we equated our variable on obesity 
as the dependent variable as shown as the output of our function. Since we
set our dependent variable as obesity, we wanted to use linear regression
to further calculate the correlation it has with our independent variables
as represented by x which were on income and food score. With the given 
equation y = a1x1 + a2x2, we were also given predictor values that would
provide or "predict" the outcome of our calculation on the relationship
between our dependent variables on our independent variable, obesity.
