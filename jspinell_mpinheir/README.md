CS 591 Project 1

For our project we decided to try and answer the question, “If a family with presumably one or two children who are preparing to go to college were to move to Boston, what would be the most ideal area to move to?” To answer this question, we obtained and scraped data from multiple online sources that included Boston and Cambridge housing rates, crime rates, populations by age, corresponding neighborhoods to zip codes and education information that included graduation rates and cost of living. All of the data sets we used were organized by zip code, which allowed us to make 3 data sets that found correlations between 2-bedroom apartment rates, crime rates and college graduation rates. The datasets we used were created on our own from the data we scraped and uploaded into datamechanics.io, the sources are listed below. We struggled with being able to find the data provenance information required for the assignment. To transform our data, we created tiers of housing prices and mapped averages of crime data, graduation rates, and populations of ages 15-19 for those respective areas.
