We wish to find a favorable place to build a new public school in Boston. Our data sets include the existing public schools, police stations, fire stations, MBTA stations and current Crime Incident report. Our data sets are from three sources, City of Boston, Boston Open Data and erikdemaine.org. The new public school should near police stations fire stations MBTA stations and avoid the areas with high Crime rate.

Transformation one: We combine the public schools and hospitals in Boston according to their zip codes

Transformation two:We combine the crime incidents and Fire departments in Boston according to their street address.

Transformation three: We combine the public schools and police stations in Boston according to their street address.
