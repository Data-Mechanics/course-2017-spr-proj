Improving Public Schools in Boston


We wish to evaluate the accessibilities of the public schools in Boston and provide improvement suggestions for public schools in different regions. There are 4 accessibilities index that we are taking into account - Police Stations, Markets, Gardens and Hospitals.


Transformation 1 k-means + scoring mechanism:

We use K-means clustering algorithm to divide Boston public school into 5 regions by calculating 5 clustered central points and calculating which is the nearest central point for each school.(see graph.png)

To calculate the accessibility score, we only consider the accessibilities within 2 km range of each school.
The accessibilities scores of each school are generated by the following equation:
Score = #Garden+ #Market +1.5 #Police Station +1.5 #Hospital

Then, we calculate the average score of each region and apply 90 percent confidence interval to test whether the score of certain region is significant below the average.

If a region has a score that significant below the average, the schools in that cluster should make contact with government to demand an increase of certain accessibilities around their neighborhood.

Results:
School Sample Size:133
Region Size:5
School Average score= 56.03
School Std = 38.80

Region 1:
School Number: 17
Average:40.2
T score:0.82
P value:0.44

Region 2:
School Number:37
Average:81.36
T score: -1.44
P value:0.22

Region 3:
School Number:38
Average:78.65
T score: -1.26
P value: 0.27

Region 4:
School Number: 15
Average: 29.06
T score:1.55
P value:0.19

Region 5:
School Number:26
Average:18
T score:2.18
P value:0.094

Only Region 5 is significantly below the average, thus we suggest the schools in that region make contact with government to make improvement.



Transformation 2 correlation:

Distance: Distance between school and its cluster central.
Accessibilities score: the accessibilities score of the school.

We calculate the correlations between the Distances and Accessibilities of every public school in Boston to understand whether the the school closer to clustered center usually has higher accessibility. A high correlation coefficients(>0.5) means schools that close to its cluster central have more accessibility.

The results show that the correlation coefficient between distance and accessibility is -0.27 and P value is 1.0 which means that there is no correlation between the Distances and Accessibilities of Boston public schools.

Consequently, the result infers that public schools are not clustered based on accessibility. Thus it is necessary to look into the accessibility score of each score and optimize their accessibility needs.

The Data Sets Involved

Data sets include the existing public schools, police stations, market, gardens and Hospitals.

Data sets are from three sources, City of Boston, Boston Open Data and erikdemaine.org.
