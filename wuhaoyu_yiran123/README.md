# Introduction
Our purpose for this semester-long project is to optimize the surroundings of universities to improve the occurrence of traffic jam.    
Project1 is aiming to investigate several aspects which influence the existence of traffic jam near universities in the City of Boston. There are five datasets we used for our research. University, traffic signal location, bus stop location, traffic jam information, and road location. Centered by universities, within 2 miles, we want to find out the relation among university populations, university operating time, the number of traffic signals, the number of bus stops, the occurrence time of traffic jam and the number of traffic jam.     
In the first project, we combined the traffic jam with road map to get the coordination of each street. We also gather all the traffic lights within the 2 miles of each university and store the distance for each of the light and its corresponding university.  Then we count the number of MBTA bus stops within the 2 miles of each university.
